# ImageScrap
Scrapping images from website, using selenium to navigate website

Simple Setup GUIDE:
1. Install Python (This is using 3.5)
2. Install pip (windows python contains pip already, just need to add Python_root/Script folder to environment variables)
3. Use pip install to install Selenium
4. Download chrome driver for selenium to use chrome
5. Modify chrome driver dir inside the source code
6. Run this python program


Tips:
The reason to use Selenium is that MK website shows new images while you scroll down the page, without scrolling you can't find all images. Selenium could simulate scrolling.
